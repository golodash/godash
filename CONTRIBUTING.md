## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](/README.md).

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the project or docs, search if the [issue already exists](https://github.com/gotorn/godash/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/gotorn/godash/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/gotorn/godash/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we don‚Äôt assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

1. Fork the repository.
2. Git clone your forked version of project.
3. Make your changes locally.
4. Test and debug your changes.(If you want, you can add test cases too)
5. Add documentation for your new functions, interfaces and other important new things you added.
6. If your code is done, DON'T FORGET to add your changes to [**CHANGELOG**](/CHANGELOG.rst) under **UNRELEASED** section. (If you wanna know how to edit the CHANGELOG, have a look at [CHANGELOG](#changelog) section)
7. If you are sure of your code, commit your changes (there are rules for commits in [Commit Rules](#commit-rules) section, have a look)
8. Create a pull request.
9. Wait for the review:
   1.  If the reviewer asked you something to add or change to your code, do that and then comeback and inform us about the changes.
   2.  If the review rejected, we will inform you about the reason for sure.
   3.  If the review passed and pull request happened, thank you. we are happy to have you and we appreciate your work. :sparkles:. 

So in summary:
1. Do the changes.
2. Debug and be sure about the changes.
3. Add documentation for new functions and variables and new...
4. Add changes you made to the changelog. (see [CHANGELOG](#changelog))
5. Commit your changes. (see [Commit Rules](#commit-rules))
6. Create a pull request.

### Changelog

Under **UNRELEASED** section, write a simple sentence of what you did.
For example:
- In `Errors` package when `New` function is called without a pointer but with a variable passed as parameters, it doesn't panic anymore.
- Interfaces for internal `Service` package added.

### Commit Rules

There is a template for how to commit:

- **[Sticker] [PastFormOfVerb] [Package](can be empty) [Function](can be empty), [Extra]**

#### Stickers

There are some stickers to use in a commit which are:
1. üêõ Fixed
   - Means you found and fixed a bug somewhere.
2. üîß Updated
    - Means you updated someone elses code with new code. (you made optimization or better behavior)
3. ‚úÖ Added
    - Means you added something new. (a function, a variable, a whole new package...)
4. ‚ùå Deleted
    - Means you deleted something. (a file, a function, a variable, a whole package...)
5. ‚úèÔ∏è Renamed
    - Means you renamed a (folder-file)'s name to something else.
6. üìÅ Moved
    - Means you moved a (folder-file) to somewhere else.
7. üêû #IssueID
   - Means you fixed an issue from [issues](https://github.com/gotorn/godash/issues) section of this repository.

Let's have some examples of each one of them:
1. üêõ Fixed translator translate, line 19-38
2. üîß Updated logger log, code optimized
3. ‚úÖ Added config
4. ‚ùå Deleted translator translator, line 19
5. ‚úèÔ∏è Renamed logger, `/logger/warnning.go` to `/logger/warning.go`
6. üìÅ Moved logger, `/logger/warning.go` to `/functions/warning.go` folder
7. üêû #14 translator translate, error returns instead of panic

**Note**: If you changed more than one thing in your code, do a multiline commit or commit them separately.
**Note**: This is not really important to act exactly as [Commit Rules](#commit-rules) said but at least use relevant **stickers** and say which **package** in your commits you have changed.

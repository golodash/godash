</p>

Godash is inspired by [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) nodejs utility library delivering modularity.

Basically we are going to use their documentation and recreate what they did in nodejs, inside golang and of course if anyone wants to add more tools than lodash documentation, please feel free to create an issue, fork and contribute.

## How to install

Simply write:
```bash
go get github.com/golodash/godash
```

Note: version 1.X.X is compatible with go version 1.17 and higher.

## Progress

- [X] `functions` package with different functions added.
- [X] `generals` package with different functions added.
- [X] `maths` package with different functions added.
- [X] `numbers` package with different functions added.
- [X] `slices` package with different functions added.
- [X] `strings` package with different functions added.
- [X] Added different test cases and benchmarks for every function. (not for alias functions)
- [X] Library added to pkg.go.dev.

## Documentation

Whole documentation can be accessed in [godash.maktoobgar.ir](https://godash.maktoobgar.ir) web address.

**Note**: If documentation is not ready for your desired function, use function's documentation which is a comment on top of the function until all documents get ready.

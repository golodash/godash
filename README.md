# What Is Godash?

<p align="center">
<img src="images/golang.png"></img>
</p>

Godash is inspired by [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) nodejs utility library delivering modularity.

Basically we are going to use their documentation and recreate what they did in nodejs, inside golang and of course if anyone wants to add more tools than lodash documentation, please feel free to create an issue, fork and contribute.
## Our Goals

This is a repository driven by golang community, 

If you love to contribute, please do, we appreciate it.

And ofcourse don't forget to read [CONTRIBUTING](/CONTRIBUTING.md) documentation to know about how to contribute in this project.
